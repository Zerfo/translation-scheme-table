#This page, displays a list of translation schemes in the form tables
  **These schemas are stored in localStorage. When you first open the page a button is displayed and a table with a header and a line is added. "There are no schemes,Add"**
  
  **The user fills in all the fields (they are all mandatory) and after successful saving
    A new row appears in the table with the new data. If not all fields are filled, then
    You can not save this form, validation errors appear only after you click
    Add button in the dialog. "Cancel" leads to the closure of the dialogue and the loss of all
    entered data. It is worth paying special attention to the fact that the original language is not equal to either
    one translation language, otherwise - a validation error is displayed.**
  
  **Any scheme can be edited, for this, when you hover over a row in the table
    a special pencil icon appears in the "Name" box:**
